_Hi, Iâ€™m Yahaya Salisu_

#### Smart Contract Developer

I build secure and efficient smart contracts using Solidity for EVM-based protocols. My focus is on DeFi primitives, ERC standards, staking, vault systems, and reward logic. I value clean architecture, gas optimization, and security-aware design.

### Tools & Stack
1. *Foundry* for unit testing, fuzzing, deployment, and mainnet forking  
2. *Remix* for prototyping and quick iterations  
3. *Slither* for checking potential vulnerabilities early

### Projects Built
1. ERC20 token with mint, burn, deposit, and withdraw extensions  
2. Lending module with borrow, repay, liquidation, and accrueInterest logic  
3. Custom staking & reward system with time-based emission  
4. Vault architecture for isolated strategies & modular upgrades  
5. Tokenized collateral system with liquidation thresholds

### Availability
I'm currently *open to*
-  Protocol development (Remote or Hybrid)
-  Freelance or part-time Solidity projects
-  Collaborations on DeFi tools & libraries

You can hire me to build your protocol securely and efficiently.  
I offer *per-module* and *weekly* pricing to fit your scope and goals.
